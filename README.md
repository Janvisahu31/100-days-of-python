#  Algorithms in Python

Welcome to the **Algorithms in Python** repository!  
This repo contains implementations of classic algorithms and data structures written from scratch in Python.  

Each algorithm is placed in a relevant folder and implemented in its own file for easy understanding and reuse.

## Contribution Guide

- Implement algorithms in Python from scratch.
- Each algorithm should be implemented in a separate `.py` file inside the appropriate folder.
- Name files clearly (e.g., `bubble_sort.py`, `dijkstra.py`).
- Feel free to add comments and example usage inside each file.
